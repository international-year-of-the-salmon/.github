## Hi there 👋

🙋Welcome to the International Year of the Salmon organizational GitHub account - Here you will find all the processed data sets collected by the international expeditions

🐟 Some of the repositories are private because data haven't been released to the public yet. If you're an IYS participant and would like to access private data, please be sure to sign up for a free GitHub account and then provide your username to iys.data@hakai.org and we will add you as a member!

👨🏽‍💻 The repositories all contain the following folders:
   
`original_data` contains processed data files that have been sent to the IYS Data Scientists that have not been formatted to the IYS Data Template.
`IYS_data_template` contains the processed data files that have been provided in the IYS Data Template.
`standardized_data` contains the standardized data tables as they will be published to OBIS or ERDDAP.
`scripts` contains the code used to format the data files from either the `original_data` or `IYS_data_template folder` to the data tables as found in `standardized_data`.
`docs` contains any supplementary material, protocols, changelogs etc relevant for data interpretation.   

🦐 New to GitHub? It can be as easy as searching repositories and downloading files! For the full intro to why we're using GitHub to share data, see [this paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159.pdf)
