## Hi there 👋

🙋Welcome to the International Year of the Salmon organizational GitHub account - Here you will find all the raw and processed data sets collected by the interntaional expeditions

🐟 Some of the repositories are private because data haven't been released to the public yet. If you're an IYS participant and would like to access private data, please be sure to sign up for a free GitHub account and then provide your username to iys.data@hakai.org and we will add you as a member!

🦐 New to GitHub? It can be as easy as searching repositories and downloading files! For the full intro to why we're using GitHub to share data, see [this paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159.pdf)
